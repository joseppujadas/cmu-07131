[BONUS]
An ardent fan of the magical tales, you bought a copy of the newest edition
as soon as it came out. As you opened up the first page, you were baffled by
the unfamiliar yet English like words and phrases. You realized, in a rush,
you accidentally ordered the Scots edition. But,

No worries! The nice and kind publisher GPI-CMU has included a (s)ubsitution
manual to translate the following paragraphs of text into plain old English.
All you need is some [macro]magic from the all powerful vim. After you are
done translating, you can safely (d)iscard the lines containing the manual.

    Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to
    say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were
    the last people you would expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
    because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

    Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
    drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck,
    although he did have a very big mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and
    blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in
    very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences,
    spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in
    their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
